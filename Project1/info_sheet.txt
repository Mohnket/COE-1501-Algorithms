Name:  Tyler Mohnke

Lecture section:  1240

Recitation day and time:  Friday 2-2:50pm

Assignment #:  1

Program due date:  2/8/2018

Handed in date:  2/6/2018

Source code file name(s):
ac_test.java






Other file name(s) (if relevant):
dictionay.txt
user_history.txt (generated by program)
approach.txt
info_sheet.txt




Does your program run without error?: No

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:
If the file user_history.txt was modified between runs of this program there is a chance of an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
To avoid this problem, don't modify user_history.txt or attempt to use your own user_history.txt

Similarly; the program assumes one word per line in dictionary.txt. If this is changed, the application may show some odd behaviour.




Additional comments to the grader:

The StringValue class exists because I couldn't think of a better way to return both the key and the value of a given
mappiing in sorted order.
