# COE-1501-Algorithms
COE 1501 projects at the University of Pittsburgh

Project 1       The only good project. Probably because it was easy.
Project 2       This one is bad because it was building off some one else's code which is always difficult.
Project 3       This one should not be used under any circumstances because it has a bad design. Feel free to see for
                yourself. It does however work.
Project 4       Some functions are implemented better than others.
Project 5       Known bugs when handling negative numbers, so I just never deal with negative numbers
